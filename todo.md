i deleted this by accident omg

set up tests properly
post random data to ensure it always overwrites into test dir

set up test to post to db

retractively use api to populate db

FUTURE:

make test.js point at some server specified in env

make testing more automated

maybe gh workflow to pull and pm2 restart from server
